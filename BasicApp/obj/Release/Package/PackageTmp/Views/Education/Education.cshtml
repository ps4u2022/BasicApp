                <p class="card-text">
                    It is a known fact that university level textbooks are rather expensive. Textbooks have surprisingly outpaced the cost of almost every other element involved in university level education including tuition fees. This results in students deterring from buying them. Cloud-based textbooks are an effective solution to this problem. Digital content tends to be lot less expensive thus,
                    allowing lower-income students to get access to the same quality of learning material as other students.
